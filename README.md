VideoPlugin - Mission Planner Plugin for displaying low latency video NOT in the HUD
V1.0 by EosBandi - 2023.09.22

 Requires https://github.com/EosBandi/mpv.net

 Video URL can be set in CAM_URL parameter in config.xml The setting will be there after the first run
 but you can add it upfront :
 <CAM_URL>full url for video stream</CAM_URL>

 Clone https://github.com/EosBandi/Mvp.net and https://github.com/EosBandi/VideoPlugin repositories
 then add both projects to the "Plugins" folder in the Mission Planner Solution root. (Not the plugins folder in the Mission Planner project!)
 Build Mvp.net then VideoPlugin then build and start MissionPlanner as usual
 
Note: This is a POC code, for customizations contact me at eosbandi@eosbandi.com
